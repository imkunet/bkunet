very bad opinion home manager modules that makes your brain melt

## why did i make this

i use this so i can just quickly put my awful dots on your server

you see, there are some environments that are unfortunately not nixos.
that's ok! i just throw this on the server and then everything is fixed.

also, there are environments that i work in where there's no root
access for me. aw :( well, luckily since this is HM only this works
without root using [nix-user-chroot](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-user-chroot).
see how to use it in the [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) guide.

## what does everything do??? i'm very confused

that's ok. just look in [GUIDE.md](./GUIDE.md)!

## how2install it?

see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)
